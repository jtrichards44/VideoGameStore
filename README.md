# VideoGameStore

In my project, I was imagining if i was a manager at a video game store some of the functions I would want to track and change my inventory. This meet the requirments for my class but not everything on it is working like I want my final too and be sellable code for a client but at the same time i am happy with my project, leared a lot, and can't wait to continue to implement and grow for the future. 

Going into my project the main screen has a simple 3 button functionality (was 4 but again stop functioning needs fixing and just commented out so gladly look through and if problem is reconizable feel free to email me, jesserichards2292@yahoo.com). The Add/update button, adds and updates a video game to the repo and saves it. The find button, searches the data base and finds the video by name (again future update will search by other properties like UPC for example). and the delete button, does the same thing as find but then by clicking the "X" image at the end of the row deletes the item from the repo.

This project was a lot of work and research for me to get it working. I had so much fun and will continue to have fun with this project for many to come and excited to make more and more changes to make it better more understandable and maybe the perfect teaching tool for me and future colleagues.

P.S. dont forget to publish the database, in VideoGameStore,
